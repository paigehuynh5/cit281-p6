Purpose: To practice creating and using JavaScript classes by building a digital book library system that includes a Book class and a Library class.

## Project 6
Purpose:
The purpose of this project was to build a full client-server web application using Node.js and Express. The app allows users to interact with a list of items by performing all four main HTTP operations: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. It was designed to give hands-on experience working with server routes, APIs, error handling, and front-end integration.

Technologies: Node.js, Express.js, HTML / CSS / JavaScript, Fetch API, Git & GitHub

Learned: I learned how to set up and structure an Express server with RESTful routes for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, and how to use fetch() to send and receive JSON data between the client and server. I also gained experience handling errors, organizing full-stack projects, and using Git and GitHub for version control and project hosting.
