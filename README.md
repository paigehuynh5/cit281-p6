# CIT 281 Project 6

## Lab 7
Goal: Create a GitHub personal website with Pages, set up and clone repos, write Node.js JavaScript files, handle errors, and push changes to GitHub.

Purpose:
The purpose of this project was to build a full client-server web application using Node.js and Express. The app allows users to interact with a list of items by performing all four main HTTP operations: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. It was designed to give hands-on experience working with server routes, APIs, error handling, and front-end integration.
